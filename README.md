# Yinzer Hangman Version 2

## Description

Yinzer Hangman is a console-based hangman game with a Pittsburghese twist. Built for fun and as a portfolio piece to enhance my job search, this project represents my 2nd attempt and version of the game. Now, with version 2, I am incorporating more Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This required me to break up my wonderful God-class into separate methods and then take those methods and put them into separate classes to clean things up n'at.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET SDK must be installed on your machine.

### How to Play

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/YinzerHangman.git
cd YinzerHangman
dotnet run

Follow the on-screen instructions to play the Yinzer Hangman game.

Gameplay
The game selects a random Pittsburghese word or phrase. Some of these are easy while others are quite challenging, especially for none Pittsburghers and sports haters and people who are good spellers.
You have five chances to guess the word by either guessing letter by letter or the entire word or phrase including all of the proper spaces and punctuation.
The game displays a hangman figure for incorrect guesses, it builds each section of the hangman drawing based on how many incorrect attempts you make.
Correct guesses reveal the correct guesses(letters or characters) of the hidden word or phrase as you go along. And the word is revealed once you have guessed all of the letters.
You don't get to see the answer if you run out of guesses.
Customization
Customize the list of Pittsburghese words and their hints in the yinzWords Dictionary.
Modify game rules and structure in the code.
